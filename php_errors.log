[28-May-2023 09:32:06 UTC] 2023-05-28T09:32:06+00:00 [info] User Deprecated: Method "Symfony\Component\EventDispatcher\EventSubscriberInterface::getSubscribedEvents()" might add "array" as a native return type declaration in the future. Do the same in implementation "App\EventSubscriber\RegisterEvent" now to avoid errors or add an explicit @return annotation to suppress this message.
